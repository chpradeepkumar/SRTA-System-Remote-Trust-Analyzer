# 🔐 SRTA – Smart Remote Trust Analyzer

SRTA (Smart Remote Trust Analyzer) is a behavior-based cybersecurity monitoring system that evaluates the trustworthiness of a computer system by analyzing runtime activity and detecting potential remote access or suspicious behavior.

Unlike traditional signature-based security tools, SRTA focuses on **system behavior** such as command-line usage and remote access applications to dynamically calculate a **trust score** and classify the system state as SAFE, WARNING, or CRITICAL.
